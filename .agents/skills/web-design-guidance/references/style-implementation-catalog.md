# Implementable visual-style reference catalog (22 directions)

This is a **research-backed implementation reference**, not a list of required presets and not a ready-made stylesheet. Entries record a concrete visual reference or a primary implementation reference, transferable visual grammar, a viable web implementation path, and a falsifiable acceptance check. Reference links were located for this task; their CSS and images are **not** automatically authorized for copying. Some are aesthetic examples, others are technical primary sources: distinguish these before reuse.

## Selection and reference protocol

1. Honor explicit user direction, repository design/brand/tokens, and shipped behavior before selecting a style; the catalog does not override them. Identify the primary *axis*: philosophy, aesthetic, surface/material, composition, or typography. Do not indiscriminately combine 22 styles.
2. For a substantial new visual direction, inspect 2–5 **task-relevant** references: at least one authentic visual specimen and one implementable source/component or platform reference where possible. Inspect layout, typography, surface, content density, state behavior and responsive behavior; save a bounded note identifying what NOT to copy. A reference link is a starting point, not proof that a particular target product will look right.
3. Translate the chosen style to the actual stack: existing CSS variables/theme, existing component states, existing breakpoint convention, real content, and asset/license budget. If the reference uses 3D/WebGL/complex imagery but there is no corresponding content or performance budget, choose a static authored asset or a different direction; CSS gradients are not an equivalent substitute for a photograph or illustration.
4. Implement a **vertical slice** first: one representative hero/module and one real interactive control with hover, active, focus-visible, disabled when applicable, dark/light if supported, narrow/mobile layout, and long/translated text. Verify pixels and interactions before propagating style through the app.
5. Keep effects in decorative or contextual layers, not across all content. Motion must preserve reduced-motion; busy materials need solid readable foregrounds. Underlying HTML semantics, reading/tab order, loading/error/empty states and existing business behavior must remain valid. Check WCAG 2.2 text contrast 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text where applicable, plus appropriate non-text contrast and existing stricter rules.
6. Stop and report as partially verified if no browser/rendering path exists: a catalog entry, CSS draft or green unit test does not prove the finished style is visually successful.

## 22 distinct directions

### 01. Claymorphism

- **Axis:** material / playful.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/03/claymorphism-css-ui-design-trend/).
- **Visual grammar:** A soft, convex *object* with an outer drop shadow and two inset highlights/shades; rounded silhouette, coherent light direction.
- **Implement:** Tokenize fill, radius (start ~28–48px), one tinted outer and two inset `box-shadow` layers. Apply to a few hero objects/buttons, not every input.
- **Acceptance:** Compare convex vs pressed state; body copy stays crisp, 320px layout fits.

### 02. Cybercore

- **Axis:** aesthetic / retro-digital.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://trends.daisyui.com/trend/cybercore/).
- **Visual grammar:** Early-digital nostalgia: icy cobalt, chrome, compact window-like panels and *curated* hardware/digital artifacts. Not interchangeable with dark dystopian cyberpunk.
- **Implement:** Build static SVG/optimized WebP art plus CSS pixel-aligned window frames, selective chrome gradients and mono metadata. Reserve noisy overlay for decorative hero only.
- **Acceptance:** Controls remain readable without artifacts; licensed/original imagery only.

### 03. Neo-brutalism

- **Axis:** visual attitude / material.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://neobrutalism.com/docs).
- **Visual grammar:** Flat saturated fills, thick near-black outlines, zero-blur hard offset shadow and intentionally conspicuous controls.
- **Implement:** Shared CSS tokens for 2–4px border, 4–6px hard shadow, compact radius; `:active` translates into the shadow; preserve `:focus-visible` outline.
- **Acceptance:** No soft shadow/gradient substitution; pressed/focus and small-screen states work.

### 04. Scrapbook

- **Axis:** aesthetic / collage.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/examples/Scrapbook.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Hand-assembled hierarchy: layered photo/paper cutouts, tape, slight rotations and handwritten *annotation* (not body text).
- **Implement:** Layer positioned decorative SVG/PNG only inside a bounded hero; use CSS `clip-path`/pseudo-elements for torn edge and tape; normal-flow DOM for articles and buttons.
- **Acceptance:** At 320px and 200% zoom no overlap with text/controls; assets have source and rights.

### 05. Surrealism

- **Axis:** art direction / imagery.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/surrealism).
- **Visual grammar:** Unlikely juxtapositions and scale/context shifts around one deliberate visual concept; not random visual noise.
- **Implement:** Use one original/licensed cutout composite or masked SVG/3D scene in hero, with a readable conventional navigation/content layer. Provide a nonanimated poster fallback.
- **Acceptance:** Meaningful focal concept is identifiable; no unreadable navigation, autoplay or copied artwork.

### 06. Y2K aesthetic

- **Axis:** aesthetic / 1997–2004 retro-futurism.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/examples/Y2K_Futurism.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Optimistic chrome, translucent plastic, glossy highlights and curved/techno typography rather than generic neon sci-fi.
- **Implement:** Design a finite 3–5-stop metallic gradient token and specular edge; render hero motifs as authored SVG/WebP; keep functional UI on opaque surface.
- **Acceptance:** Highlight is controlled; text/background contrast and mobile rendering pass.

### 07. Pixel art

- **Axis:** illustration / raster discipline.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Crisp_pixel_art_look).
- **Visual grammar:** Deliberate low-resolution sprites with visible square pixels and restrained palette, not a blurry photo under `pixelated`.
- **Implement:** Author true small raster sprite/sprite sheet, scale by integer factors where possible and set `image-rendering: pixelated`; keep body and controls normal-resolution.
- **Acceptance:** Sprites remain crisp at target zoom/DPR; alt text and non-pixel text remain readable.

### 08. Synthwave

- **Axis:** aesthetic / 1980s retro-futurism.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/designs/Synthwave.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Horizon grid, deep violet sky, sunset gradient and pink/cyan highlights; distinct from Y2K's chrome and Cyberpunk's gritty signage.
- **Implement:** One perspective grid via `transform: perspective(...) rotateX(...)` in hero or SVG poster; background gradient + limited accents; no infinite animation required.
- **Acceptance:** Grid never crosses text; mobile uses simplified still art; reduced motion respected.

### 09. Glassmorphism

- **Axis:** material / contextual translucency.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/backdrop-filter).
- **Visual grammar:** A small number of translucent surfaces reveal useful scene context through actual background blur.
- **Implement:** Opaque fallback first, then `@supports (backdrop-filter: blur(1px))` for isolated nav/sheet; translucent fill, hairline rim, restrained blur. Do not blur nested scrolling cards.
- **Acceptance:** Check variable backgrounds, contrast and low-end/mobile GPU; opaque fallback remains usable.

### 10. Neumorphism

- **Axis:** material / subtle extrusion.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://neumorphism.io/).
- **Visual grammar:** A surface seemingly pressed out of *the same-color* canvas using opposing light/dark shadows; unlike clay's separate convex object.
- **Implement:** Tokenize base fill, symmetric paired soft shadows, inset pressed variant and an independent clear focus/selected indicator.
- **Acceptance:** Button borders/states remain identifiable without relying on low-contrast shadow alone.

### 11. Bento grid

- **Axis:** composition / modular hierarchy.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/examples/Bento_Grid.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Unequal tiles encode genuinely unequal module importance, with a consistent gutter; not a synonym for many rounded cards.
- **Implement:** Use CSS Grid with explicit `grid-column: span 2` for important modules, `minmax(0,1fr)` and content-derived reflow to two/one columns.
- **Acceptance:** DOM/tab order remains logical after reflow; content fits without fixed heights.

### 12. Editorial design

- **Axis:** composition / narrative typography.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/designs/Editorial_Magazine_Layout.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Magazine-like scale contrast, rhythm, captions, image cropping, multi-column reading and clear typographic roles.
- **Implement:** Establish fluid display/body sizes, article `max-inline-size` in characters, two-column headline/media hero and caption pattern; keep long reading in a single measure.
- **Acceptance:** Reading order, heading outline, mobile line lengths and zoom remain correct.

### 13. Swiss design

- **Axis:** philosophy / systematic graphic grid.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/designs/International_Typographic_Style.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Rational asymmetry, strong sans typography, measurable baseline/column rhythm, minimal ornament. Not simply all-black minimalism.
- **Implement:** Define 8/12-column grid, explicit alignment and a strict type scale; establish display/caption roles and asymmetric but structured placement.
- **Acceptance:** No arbitrary offsets; reading order and responsive grid survive translation.

### 14. Minimalism

- **Axis:** philosophy / reduction.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/designs/Neo_Minimalism.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Emphasis through removal, proportion and whitespace rather than empty screens with giant text.
- **Implement:** Reduce controls and decorative elements first, set one hierarchy/one accent, constrain measure, reveal secondary actions contextually without hiding essentials.
- **Acceptance:** Every remaining item has a job; actions and empty/error/focus states stay discoverable.

### 15. Maximalism

- **Axis:** philosophy / expressive density.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/designs/Digital_Collage.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Abundance coordinated by a focal hierarchy, distinct type scales, layers and bounded motif repetition.
- **Implement:** Budget 1 dominant region and 2 supporting patterns; use design tokens for 3–4 accent roles; isolate texture/art layers from the reading/control plane.
- **Acceptance:** Can identify primary CTA/heading in one scan; small screens simplify layers rather than shrinking everything.

### 16. Luxury typography

- **Axis:** typography / refined identity.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/examples/Quiet_Luxury.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Display typography carries identity with exact kerning, contrast and proportion; restrained palette and calibrated whitespace.
- **Implement:** Use a licensed display serif/variable family only for large headings, optical-size/features where available, measured `clamp()` and neutral readable body; preload/subset where licensing allows.
- **Acceptance:** Korean/Latin fallback and glyph coverage verified; no tiny thin body type or faux luxury tracking.

### 17. Conceptual sketch

- **Axis:** illustration / process language.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://roughjs.com/).
- **Visual grammar:** Deliberately provisional linework, callouts, arrows and measured annotations imply ideation or process, not a sloppy finished layout.
- **Implement:** Draw static SVG strokes and dashed rulers first; add Rough.js only when reproducible hand-drawn geometry is truly needed; seed/render once, not every frame.
- **Acceptance:** Text, controls and technical dimensions remain precise; decorative strokes are aria-hidden.

### 18. Ethereal

- **Axis:** atmosphere / soft light.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/examples/Ethereal.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Airy tonal transitions, softly lit imagery, restrained glow and generous space with legible foreground text.
- **Implement:** Layer 2–3 stationary radial gradients behind content, selectively diffuse hero art (not text), use solid foreground panels/ink text.
- **Acceptance:** Text contrast remains valid over every gradient stop; no blanket blur on UI.

### 19. Bohemian

- **Axis:** aesthetic / crafted eclecticism.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/examples/Global_Village_Coffeehouse.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Warm earth pigments, textile/craft rhythm and layered handwork, distinct from Scrapbook's literal paper collage.
- **Implement:** Choose an authentic original/appropriately licensed craft motif, reusable warm color tokens and border/background pattern limited to framing. Use simple humanist body text.
- **Acceptance:** Avoid treating distinct cultures as interchangeable decor; use provenance and keep pattern away from body copy.

### 20. Victorian

- **Axis:** historical / ornamental typography.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://chrislemke.github.io/website_designs/examples/Victorian.html).
- **Visual grammar:** Formal axis, ornate framed title blocks, engraved ornaments and dense serif hierarchy rather than generic gold-on-black.
- **Implement:** Prepare reusable SVG corner/filigree assets and formal display serif; place ornamental borders only on hero/section breaks, with normal controls below.
- **Acceptance:** Decorations hide/reduce on mobile; text is real HTML and art assets are original/licensed.

### 21. Cyberpunk

- **Axis:** world-building / dystopian technology.
- **Reference:** [Inspect an actual Cyberpunk CSS component demo](https://alddesign.github.io/cyberpunk-css/demo/).
- **Visual grammar:** Nocturnal urban infrastructure, industrial HUD/scarred surfaces and purposeful hazard/information color; unlike nostalgic Cybercore or sunset Synthwave.
- **Implement:** Create layered signage/HUD using crisp SVG panels, grid/rule geometry and 1–2 status accents; put glitch in occasional nonessential artwork only.
- **Acceptance:** Critical state is labeled, not color-only; focus and status never flicker.

### 22. Wabi-sabi

- **Axis:** philosophy / material imperfection.
- **Reference:** [Inspect design or implementation](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/wabi-sabi/).
- **Visual grammar:** Restrained asymmetry, quiet natural textures, material variation and meaningful imperfection, not random CSS jitter or merely beige.
- **Implement:** Use photographed/illustrated original material once, off-axis image placement within a stable grid, warm-neutral semantic tokens and unforced generous reading space.
- **Acceptance:** Organic surface does not impair precise alignment of interactive controls; imagery rights recorded.

- Record reference URL + inspected feature + implementation decision; do not claim a library is maintained, compatible, licensed for a specific use, or a page is a live production example without checking its current state. For original/art-heavy styles, secure suitable asset licenses and preserve attribution where required. Do not hotlink third-party demo assets or copy logos, exact branded compositions, proprietary artwork, or reference product copy.
- A style is **implemented**, not merely named, only after it changes the actual target surface's layout/type/material/asset/component grammar, includes applicable interaction and responsive variants, and has rendered evidence at the target source revision. A CSS-token-only recolor is not evidence that Surrealism, Scrapbook, Victorian or Cyberpunk is realized.
